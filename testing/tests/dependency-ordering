# This test puts in place a dependecy tree, installs the tree's root package,
# and verifies that package builds and testing honors the dependency ordering:
# depended-upon packages need to be built and available prior to dependers.
# The package tree:

# foo  ---> bar ----> grault
#     \            /
#      baz -> corge
#
# To verify the ordering we use package executables that dependers require both
# in test_command and build_command. This leverages the fact that executables
# transparently appear in a bin/ directory in the test staging area. foo's build
# & test call executables that bar and baz install; baz's build & test call
# corge's executable, bar and corge call grault's executable.

# We trigger package tests in the below, for which zkg internally looks
# for zeek-config. So require a Zeek install:
# @TEST-REQUIRES: type zeek-config

# @TEST-EXEC: BUILDLOG=$(pwd)/build.log bash %INPUT

# After testing, the packages get installed up the dependency chain, installing
# their executables into the bin folder at the test's toplevel. That directory
# isn't automatically in the path, so add it.
# @TEST-EXEC: PATH=$(pwd)/bin:$PATH zkg install foo

# Verify the order and number of times the packages got built.
# @TEST-EXEC: btest-diff build.log
