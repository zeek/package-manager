.B  package
The name(s) of package(s) to operate on.  The package may be named in several ways.  If the package is part of a package source, it may be referred to by the base name of the package (last component of git URL) or its path within the package source. If two packages in different package sources have conflicting paths, then the package source name may be prepended to the package path to resolve the ambiguity. A full git URL may also be used to refer to a package that does not belong to a source. E.g. for a package source called \(dqzeek\(dq that has a package named \(dqfoo\(dq located in either \(dqalice/zkg.index\(dq or \(dqalice/bro\-pkg.index\(dq, the following names work: \(dqfoo\(dq, \(dqalice/foo\(dq, \(dqzeek/alice/foo\(dq.

If the package name refers to a local git repo with a working tree, then its currently active branch is used. The default for other cases is to use the latest version tag, or if a package has none, the default branch, like \(dqmain\(dq or \(dqmaster\(dq.
.UNINDENT

.SS bundle
.sp
This command creates a bundle file containing a collection of Zeek packages.  If \fB\-\-manifest\fP is used, the user supplies the list of packages to put in the bundle, else all currently installed packages are put in the bundle. A bundle file can be unpacked on any target system, resulting in a repeatable/specific set of packages being installed on that target system (see the \fBunbundle\fP command).  This command may be useful for those that want to manage packages on a system that otherwise has limited network connectivity.  E.g. one can use a system with an internet connection to create a bundle, transport that bundle to the target machine using whatever means are appropriate, and finally unbundle/install it on the target machine.

The aggregated metadata is stored in the local clone of the package source that zkg uses internally for locating package metadata. For each package, the metadata is taken from the highest available git version tag or the default branch, like \(dqmain\(dq or \(dqmaster\(dq, if no version tags exist
.TP

When using \-\-aggregate, exit with error when any packages trigger metadata problems. Normally such problems only cause a warning.

.sp
This command returns shell commands that, when executed, will correctly set \fBZEEKPATH\fP and \fBZEEK_PLUGIN_PATH\fP (also \fBBROPATH\fP and \fBBRO_PLUGIN_PATH\fP for legacy compatibility) to use scripts and plugins from packages installed by the package manager. For this command to function properly, either have the \fBzeek\-config\fP script (installed by zeek) in \fBPATH\fP, or have the \fBZEEKPATH\fP and \fBZEEK_PLUGIN_PATH\fP (or \fBBROPATH\fP and \fBBRO_PLUGIN_PATH\fP) environment variables already set so this command can append package\-specific paths to them.

.TP
.B  \-\-packagedir
Output directory into which to produce the new package. Required.
.TP
.B  \-\-version
The template version to use.  A version tag, branch name, or commit hash may be specified here.  If \-\-template refers to a local git repo with a working tree, then zkg uses it as\-is and the version is ignored.  The default for other cases is to use the latest version tag, or if a template has none, the default branch, like \(dqmain\(dq or \(dqmaster\(dq.
.TP
.B  \-\-features
Additional features to include in your package. Use the \(ga\(gatemplate info\(ga\(ga command for information about available features.
.TP
.B  \-\-template
By default, zkg uses its own package template. This makes it select an alternative.
.TP
.B  \-\-force=False
Don\(aqt prompt for confirmation or user variables.
.TP
.B  \-\-user\-var
A user variable assignment. This avoids prompting for input and lets you provide a value when using \-\-force. Use repeatedly as needed for multiple values.

.TP
.B  \-\-version
The template version to report on.  A version tag, branch name, or commit hash may be specified here.  If the selected template refers to a local git repo, the version is ignored.  The default for other cases is to use the latest version tag, or if a template has none, the default branch, like \(dqmain\(dq or \(dqmaster\(dq.

.SH CONFIG FILE
.sp
The \fBzkg\fP command\-line tool uses an INI\-format config file to allow
users to customize their \fI\%Package Sources\fP, \fI\%Package\fP installation paths, Zeek executable/source paths, and other
\fBzkg\fP options.
.sp
See the default/example config file below for explanations of the
available options and how to customize them:

# This is an example config file for zkg to explain what
# settings are possible as well as their default values.
# The order of precedence for how zkg finds/reads config files:
#
# (1) zkg \-\-configfile=/path/to/custom/config
# (2) the ZKG_CONFIG_FILE environment variable
# (3) a config file located at $HOME/.zkg/config
# (4) if none of the above exist, then zkg uses builtin/default
#     values for all settings shown below

[sources]

# The default package source repository from which zkg fetches
# packages.  The default source may be removed, changed, or
# additional sources may be added as long as they use a unique key
# and a value that is a valid git URL.  The git URL may also use a
# suffix like \(dq@branch\-name\(dq where \(dqbranch\-name\(dq is the name of a real
# branch to checkout (as opposed to the default branch, which is typically
# \(dqmain\(dq or \(dqmaster\(dq). You can override the package source zkg puts
# in new config files (e.g. \(dqzkg autoconfig\(dq)  by setting the
# ZKG_DEFAULT_SOURCE environment variable.
zeek = https://github.com/zeek/packages

[paths]

# Directory where source repositories are cloned, packages are
# installed, and other package manager state information is
# maintained.  If left blank or with \-\-user this defaults to
# $HOME/.zkg. In Zeek\-bundled installations, it defaults to
# <zeek_install_prefix>/var/lib/zkg/.
state_dir =

# The directory where package scripts are copied upon installation.
# A subdirectory named \(dqpackages\(dq is always created within the
# specified path and the package manager will copy the directory
# specified by the \(dqscript_dir\(dq option of each package\(aqs zkg.meta
# (or legacy bro\-pkg.meta) file there.
# If left blank or with \-\-user this defaults to <state_dir>/script_dir.
# In Zeek\-bundled installations, it defaults to
# <zeek_install_prefix>/share/zeek/site.
# If you decide to change this location after having already
# installed packages, zkg will automatically relocate them
# the next time you run any zkg command.
script_dir =

# The directory where package plugins are copied upon installation.
# A subdirectory named \(dqpackages\(dq is always created within the
# specified path and the package manager will copy the directory
# specified by the \(dqplugin_dir\(dq option of each package\(aqs zkg.meta
# (or legacy bro\-pkg.meta) file there.
# If left blank or with \-\-user this defaults to <state_dir>/plugin_dir.
# In Zeek\-bundled installations, it defaults to
# <zeek_install_prefix>/lib/zeek/plugins.
# If you decide to change this location after having already
# installed packages, zkg will automatically relocate them
# the next time you run any zkg command.
plugin_dir =

# The directory where executables from packages are linked into upon
# installation.  If left blank or with \-\-user this defaults to <state_dir>/bin.
# In Zeek\-bundled installations, it defaults to <zeek_install_prefix>/bin.
# If you decide to change this location after having already
# installed packages, zkg will automatically relocate them
# the next time you run any zkg command.
bin_dir =

# The directory containing Zeek distribution source code.  This is only
# needed when installing packages that contain Zeek plugins that are
# not pre\-built.  The legacy name of this option is \(dqbro_dist\(dq.
zeek_dist =

[templates]

# The URL of the package template repository that the \(dqzkg create\(dq command
# will instantiate by default.
default = https://github.com/zeek/package\-template

[user_vars]

# For any key in this section that is matched for value interpolation
# in a package\(aqs zkg.meta (or legacy bro\-pkg.meta) file, the corresponding
# value is substituted during execution of the package\(aqs \(gabuild_command\(ga.
# This section is typically automatically populated with the
# the answers supplied during package installation prompts
# and, as a convenience feature, used to recall the last\-used settings
# during subsequent operations (e.g. upgrades) on the same package.
