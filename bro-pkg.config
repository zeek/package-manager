# This is an example config file for zkg to explain what
# settings are possible as well as their default values.
# The order of precedence for how zkg finds/reads config files:
#
# (1) zkg --configfile=/path/to/custom/config
# (2) the ZKG_CONFIG_FILE environment variable
# (3) a config file located at $HOME/.zkg/config
# (4) if none of the above exist, then zkg uses builtin/default
#     values for all settings shown below

[sources]

# The default package source repository from which zkg fetches
# packages.  The default source may be removed, changed, or
# additional sources may be added as long as they use a unique key
# and a value that is a valid git URL.
bro = https://github.com/bro/packages

[paths]

# Directory where source repositories are cloned, packages are
# installed, and other package manager state information is
# maintained.  If left blank, this defaults to $HOME/.zkg
state_dir =

# The directory where package scripts are copied upon installation.
# A subdirectory named "packages" is always created within the
# specified path and the package manager will copy the directory
# specified by the "script_dir" option of each package's bro-pkg.meta
# file there.
# If left blank, this defaults to <state_dir>/script_dir
# A typical path to set here is <bro_install_prefix>/share/bro/site
# If you decide to change this location after having already
# installed packages, zkg will automatically relocate them
# the next time you run any zkg command.
script_dir =

# The directory where package plugins are copied upon installation.
# A subdirectory named "packages" is always created within the
# specified path and the package manager will copy the directory
# specified by the "plugin_dir" option of each package's bro-pkg.meta
# file there.
# If left blank, this defaults to <state_dir>/plugin_dir
# A typical path to set here is <bro_install_prefix>/lib/bro/plugins
# If you decide to change this location after having already
# installed packages, zkg will automatically relocate them
# the next time you run any zkg command.
plugin_dir =

# The directory containing Bro distribution source code.  This is only
# needed when installing packages that contain Bro plugins that are
# not pre-built.
bro_dist =

[user_vars]

# For any key in this section that is matched for value interpolation
# in a package's bro-pkg.meta file, the corresponding value is
# substituted during execution of the package's `build_command`.
# This section is typically automatically populated with the
# the answers supplied during package installation prompts
# and, as a convenience feature, used to recall the last-used settings
# during subsequent operations (e.g. upgrades) on the same package.
